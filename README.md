Hello and welcome to DART--The Distributed Assessment of Risks Tool!

Why people need DART?
It is often necessary for a group of possibly non co-located stakeholders to collaboratively assess and ultimately prioritize project risks. Unfortunately, with worsens sharply with increasing numbers of stakeholders, risk assessment becomes nearly impossible when stakeholders are not all in the same place at the same time. The Distributed Assessment of Risks Tool (DART) is a means to aid risk assessment efforts by providing a web based interface for gathering stakeholder assessments, aggregate results, generate a top-n risk list, and track reassessments.

Purpose of DART:
DART is used to provide a means to address these issues with respect to project risk assessment and tracking. The tool provides an easy to use interface for project stakeholders to continuously perform and monitor top-n risk assessments. This includes acquiring risk exposure estimates for distributed stakeholders, reporting current risk assessments and priorities, gathering risk mitigation and impact information, and graphing risk exposure changes. The information can be easily exported and imported to external tools such as Excel and text based CSV format.
